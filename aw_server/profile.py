"""Profile resolution for aw-server.

A *profile* names an isolated ActivityWatch instance (data, config, port,
settings). `default` is the ordinary install, `testing` is what `--testing`
has always meant, and any other name (for example `research`) is a sibling
instance that can run at the same time as the others.

The carrier is the ``AW_PROFILE`` environment variable. aw-core's
``_get_appname()`` suffixes the platformdirs root when it is set to a
non-empty value, so exporting the profile here isolates dirs for this
process and anything it spawns — without threading a flag through the
datastore, settings, or Flask stack.

Kept in sync with aw-qt's ``aw_qt/profile.py`` (same validation rule as
aw-server-rust). One intentional difference: the default profile *unsets*
``AW_PROFILE`` instead of setting it to ``"default"``. aw-core treats any
non-empty value as a suffix, so ``AW_PROFILE=default`` would resolve to
``activitywatch-default`` and orphan an existing install.

Testing-root note (ActivityWatch/activitywatch#1399): python aw-core#149
maps ``AW_PROFILE=testing`` to ``activitywatch-testing``. The rust
isolation branch keeps testing on the bare ``activitywatch`` root so
existing ``sqlite-testing.db`` files are not orphaned. This module follows
the already-merged python dirs contract; unifying the rust testing root
is a follow-up on that isolation PR, not something to special-case here.
